### Changed

- [#61](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-migration/pull/61) changes the constructor of the `FileFilter` class to remove the initial `$path` argument, as well as to remove the `$path` property, as neither were used internally. This class is primarily an internal implementation detail; however, if you were using it in your own code, you may need to update how you create instances.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [#49](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-migration/pull/49) adds the option "--yes|-y" to the migrate command; if not provided, and the console is interactive, the command will warn the user that the command removes the `composer.lock` file and `vendor/` directory, asking them to confirm they want to continue. If they do not, or if they do not pass --yes on the command line in a non-interactive session, the command will abort.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

## 1.2.0 - 2020-04-29

### Added

- [#42](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-migration/pull/42) adds logic for migrating the "zendframework/zendframework" package to Laminas. Previously, it was left unmigrated. Now, the entry is replaced by a set of packages relevant to the given constraint listed. We recommend users who benefit from this change audit their code post-migration to remove any unused packages installed in this way.

This should prevent it rewriting code from third-party libraries.
